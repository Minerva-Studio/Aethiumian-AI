# Aethiumian-AI

This is the repository of the AI system used in our Project [Library of Meialia](https://github.com/Minerva-Studio/Library-of-Meialia), it is an implementation of [Behaviour Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_%28artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control%29) in Unity Engine.
This system is capable of running in other Unity Projects, but it requires the [Unity Utilities](https://github.com/Minerva-Studio/Unity-Utilities) library.
